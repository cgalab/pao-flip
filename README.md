# PAO-F

PAO (polygon area optimization)

# Algorithm

# Input/Output

Reads GraphML .gml or  wavefront .obj format that describes a polygon. Writes the
same format; .obj gets 3D coordinates which can be imported to programs like
Blender.

# Requirements 
- C++17 enabled complier (gcc,clang)
- CGAL 
- Linux or Mac OS


# Usage

<code>pao [-h] [-v|-s] [-obj &lt;filename&gt;] &lt;filename&gt;</code>

| options        | description           |
| -------------:|:------------- |
|  -h           |         print this help |
|  -v           |         verbose mode, shows more information about the computation |
|  -s           |         silent mode, shows no information |
|  -obj      |            write output in wavefront obj format (3D coordinates) |
|  &lt;filename&gt; |           input type is either wavefront obj or GML format |
