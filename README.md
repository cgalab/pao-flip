# PAO-FLIP

PAO-FLIP (polygon area optimization using fliping) 

# Algorithm

Given a simple polygon P, pao-flip computes the triangulation of P and CH(P). It tries to increase/decrease the bounded area of P by "flipping" reflex vertices of P and boundary edges using the triangles provided by Triangle. 

# Input/Output

Reads [GraphML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GraphML) .gml or
[wavefront](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file) .obj-format that
describes a simple polygon. Writes the permutation of the polygon (or a
wavefront .obj file).

# Requirements 
- C++17 enabled complier (gcc,clang)
- CGAL 
- Linux or Mac OS


# Usage

<code>pao [-h] [-v|-s] [-r] [-min|-max] [-area &lt;AREA&gt;] [-obj &lt;filename&gt;] &lt;filename&gt;</code>

| options        | description           |
| -------------:|:------------- |
|  -h           |         print this help |
|  -v           |         verbose mode, shows more information about the computation |
|  -s           |         silent mode, keep the output quiet except for the final permutation |
|  -min,-max    |         computes a smaller/larger polygon (default max) |
|  -r           |         enable reflex sensitive flipping |
|-sort          |         enable sorting strategy (works with both min and max) |
|  -rand        |         randomly access the vector of reflex vertices (not together with -sort)|
|  -invert      |         enable inverter (weasel's strategy)|
|  -area &lt;AREA&gt; |         state an area bound that has to be beaten| 
|  -obj         |            write output in wavefront obj format (3D coordinates) |
|  &lt;filename&gt; |           input type is either wavefront obj or GML format |
